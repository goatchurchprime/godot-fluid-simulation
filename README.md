# godot-fluid-simulation

An attempted port of [paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation](https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/) to Godot shaders.

This is done as a series of Viewports, one linking the output to the next one's input.

Implementing Bloom is an excercise left to another day.  The code is here.

It appears to require going down and then back up a series of decreasing viewport frames
